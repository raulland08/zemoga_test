# Zemoga Test
Repository for Zemoga test

For this test the MVVM architecture was selected, in order to have more organization in the project and use in a better way the Clean Architecture.

For dependency injection Koin is used, handling in an easier way all the modules in the project.

For local storage realm is used.

For API requests I use retrofit.

For unit tests I use Mockk. Mockk is great and easy to use, especially when handling the injections and mocking componets avoiding some issues with final classes that other unit test dependices have such as Mockito.
